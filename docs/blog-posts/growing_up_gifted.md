I was talking to a friend today and it really made me reminisce about the my time growing up and well err.. how it's largely shaped my personality. Playing sports and other stuff obviously had a big impact but honestly not as much as having an older sister. She taught me how to use the internet when I was probably what, 6? mostly to play games but i would learn how to navigate things like myspace and play disc games like sims 2 on our family pc. no i'm not getting into how his impacted the idea of gender for me and all of that... another time maybe. anyways

### // gifted education

First off, the gifted education program is what we'd call it for kids that excelled at certain subjects. I was tested and placed into it at the end of my second grade year since you had to be in third grade. That on top of my parents being advised to advance me in grade from first grade to third grade the year prior- it put a lot of stress on me as a kid :(

That said, I was placed into it because of my math and science comprehension because honestly, i hate english and well, i guess history is cool i just suck at it.

> on a tangent, i saw a video a long time ago discussing the relation of spectrum disorder. I honestly kind of forgot about it until this conversation with my friend, but it honestly should have been a clue to look into things. bleh-

### // between then and now

Most of my middle school was the same until 8th grade year. thinking back, i had a lot of friends and i'm still friends with quite a few of them to this day, but oh my god holy jesus. I was not a very socially aware kid; thankfully i picked it up eventually, at least well enough for a retail job. The me throughout highschool though wow was I entirely absent minded and lacking of self awareness too (foreshadowing). I'd often sabotaged my romatic relationships and tended to be alone- that continued until i was even in college.

During this time I wouldn't really be on the interwebs much, more of just playing online games on xbox and watching anime- damn do i miss the days i'd be able to finish an anime in a day ugh. I think roughly 2017 ish? is when i started playing more pc games and eventually got my first desktop computer. Though honestly all i really did was just still mostly play games and watch anime, I didn't really have an interest in social platforms or even taking pictures which is kind of sad.

obviously the internet has had a massive massive impact on who I am
