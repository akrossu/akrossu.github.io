i'm not really sure what to write here. this is mostly a test to see if my code is working.

actually, i'd like to note a little bit about how i've written this website as it's kinda cool!

<br>

## technologies i'm using:
### // svelte
an alternative to something like react that in my opini- ahem; objectively is a better developer experience that makes it by far my favorite framework to use.

### // tailwindcss
for css frameworks, anything other than tailwind just feels too cumbersome to use- especially in a robust framework like react or svelte imo.

### // glsl
glsl? what. why would I need glsl code for a website. That's what i thought! but then i had the stupid idea of making the website background as an interactive shader. This was seriously a pain...

<br>

## other stuffs:
### // hosting
i'm actually just using github pages with a domain from cloudflare! it was i think like, 12.50 usd for a year? pretty good deal. just include a `CNAME` file in your `docs/` or `build/` deploy folder for your github actions and it redirects ez pz

### // these blogs
currently I have a script that fetches a text file from the repository with the file name of each blog post. Then i just loop over that, split the file into an array and boom- using the array i can fetch all the files on page load without having to redeploy!

### // my current status
For the status you see at the top of the screen, it's genuinely a live status! it fetches from discord API and also comes with text status, game status, spotify status, etc. that would be cool to add in the future as well

### // guestbook
I found this website [\[ external:/htmlcommentbox \]](https://www.htmlcommentbox.com/) that allows you to just copy paste a working comment box, literally zero hassel it's so nice so thank you to the creators of that 人´∀｀)

<br>

## anyways
thank you if you're reading this, vist [\[ akross:/lore \]](https://akrossu.github.io/lore/) if you haven't already and sign the guestbook [\[ akross:/guestbook \]](https://akrossu.github.io/guestbook/) on your way out if you'd like to have your stamp included or say hi! any questions about how i have things setup are always welcome too!!
