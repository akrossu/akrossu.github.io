I'm not really sure what to write here. This is mostly a test see if my code is working and dynamically loading each markdown file in the github repository.

<br>

On that note actually, this website is seriously cool with the way i've set it up.

## technologies wise these are the things I'm using:

### // svelte
i absolutely love svelte and out of all the framework's i've worked with across multiple languages it is my all time favorite easily!1!

### // tailwindcss
for css framworks, anything other than tailwind just feels too cumbersome to use- especially in a robust framework like react or svelte.

### /// glsl
glsl? what. why would I need glsl code for a website. That's what i thought! but then i had the stupid idea of making the website background as an interactive shader. This was seriously a pain...

<br>

as i continue boasting a little for svelte and how cool it is, if you want to make an easily expandable, component based website reach out and i'd love to help if you're having trouble!!

<br>

so for my `current status` you see at the top of the page, it's actually querying my discord status allowing me to change it at any time and give real-time updates :D

<br>

also if you haven't visited the [\[ akross:/lore \]]() page, i'd highly recommend it. You can learn a little about ' ·®ê ', and if you squint your eyes, it looks like a cat!

## anyways

thank you if you're reading this, and if you want to connect through either a webring or just as an inclusion, just dm me on discord!
