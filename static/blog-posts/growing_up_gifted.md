I was talking to a friend today, and it really made me reminisce about my time growing up and, well, err.. how it's largely shaped my personality. Playing sports and other stuff obviously had a big impact, but honestly, not as much as having an older sister. She taught me how to use the internet when I was probably what, 6? mostly to play games, but I would learn how to navigate things like MySpace and play disc games like Sims 2 on our family PC. No, I'm not getting into how this impacted the idea of gender for me and all of that... another time maybe. anyways

## //gifted education

First off, the gifted education program is what we'd call it for kids that excelled at certain subjects. I was tested and placed into it at the end of my second grade year since you had to be in third grade. That, on top of my parents being advised to advance me in grade from first grade to third grade the year prior, put a lot of stress on me as a kid :(

<br>

That said, I was placed into it because of my math and science comprehension because, honestly, I hate English, and well, I guess history is cool; I just suck at it.

<br>

> On a tangent, I saw a video a long time ago discussing the relation of spectrum disorder. I honestly kind of forgot about it until this conversation with my friend, but it honestly should have been a clue to look into things. bleh-

## // between then and now

Most of my middle school was the same until the 8th grade year. Thinking back, I had a lot of friends, and I'm still friends with quite a few of them to this day, but oh my god, holy Jesus. I was not a very socially aware kid; thankfully, I picked it up eventually, at least well enough for a retail job. The me throughout high school though... wow, was I entirely absentminded and lacking of self-awareness too (foreshadowing). I'd often sabotaged my romantic relationships and tended to prefer being alone; that continued until I was even in college.

<br>

During this time I wouldn't really be on the interwebs much, more of just playing online games on Xbox and watching anime— damn, do I miss the days I'd be able to finish an anime in a day ugh. I think roughly 2017 ish? is when I started playing more PC games and eventually got my first desktop computer. Though honestly all I really did was just still mostly play games and watch anime, I didn't really have an interest in social platforms or even taking pictures, which is kind of sad.

<br>

## // my use of the internet

Obviously, the internet had a massive impact on who I had grown to be from around 2017 to 2021. Because of my social anxiety and hate of ig being perceived? I'd mostly stay in my own lane and not interact with much outside of my bubble. This had two effects, one being that it fortunately saved me from a lot of radical ideas from influencing me in this very maluable time in my life, but two would also obviously not allow me to be exposed to things that may have changed my outlook on life. I would honestly take the former as being more likely though, with me knowing my old self. This in-between position, this balancing act that I would be placed within, is how I approached a lot of problems, and even now I'm still trying to fix that.

<br>

## // reality check

During my second year in college, I'd meet someone who largely changed who I was. Unfortunately, they are no longer my significant other, but the experience was nothing short of life-changing. I am still extremely grateful for the relationship that was; however, with some time passing now, I realize it served as a reality check I severely needed.

<br>

Because of my largely underdeveloped social understanding and experience throughout that relationship, perhaps it was not the healthiest— I collapsed entirely. Having to build back up my foundation from what felt like scratch is finally what gave me a sense of progression and maturity, which was a nice bonus, i suppose.

<br>

## // anyways

Do I think my experiences are honestly much different from others that are in these programs? No, I genuinely don't, and it really sucks :/ There's so much stress put on kids barely old enough to write. Being that kid and looking back now, I realize how much help I really needed and often just ignored or was just oblivious to it because I was conditioned to be as a guy (oh, another blog post foreshadowed nice). Having to learn lessons the hard way obviously sucks, but it more so hurts the people around me, which is the guilt I'll have to live with.

<br>

Perhaps I just wanted a reason to write or was just looking too deep into it, but I'd like to leave this on a positive note. I wouldn't be the person I am today without these experiences, and looking back on them with the mindset of progress is all that I can do— and so should you if you at all related. There's only going to be more to experience and, of course, learn, so I suppose I'll do just that.

<br>

ik that was messy, but thank you for reading <3
