There's a lot i'd like to write down here i'm just realizing. personal, existential, philosophical- but i'm struggling with writting these as general blogs or treating it a little more private, journal-esc. I'm mostly fairly certainly positive that this'll just be a wall of text no one'll ever read but whatever. ah, and just as i open my text editor to expres my thoughts, they've all escaped..
